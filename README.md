# Circuitry

This app is a simulator that helps you tinker with the inner circuitry of a computer by creating and connecting gates together. See by yourself how far you can get into building an entire computer, combining only the base `NOT` and `AND` gates.

Circuitry is 100% web-based, and (will) use Web Assembly (WASM) for maximum performances.
